## :bulb: - Why?

<p align="justify">
Imagine having to spend more than ten minutes trying out random values in your CSS values and still not getting the best output possible. Shadow Hero is supposed to help you getting there more quickly and still allow you to try more than one possibility. Shadow Hero will not only help you finding the best shadow for your images and texts, but will also guiding you through image filtering so maybe you don't have to edit an image in another software.
